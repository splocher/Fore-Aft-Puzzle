The basic Fore & Aft puzzle can be represented on a 5X5 board, contains two different colors each with 8 identical pieces (ex., 8 red pieces and 8 blue pieces).
For this assignment, your program must be able to handle board sizes of 5X5, 7X7, 9X9, and 11X11.
Your program will ask the user for a board size, solve it within 10 seconds, and print result in a file name best.out.
Your program will receive full credit if it could solve for puzzles of all 4 boards within 10 seconds.
In addition, you could add BFS and DFS to earn up to 30 bonus points which could be added to HW2 grade without exceeding 100. Run ForeAft.exe for example of I/O and solutions for board size 5 - 11.
